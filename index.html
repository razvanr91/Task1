								My name is <span class="highlight">Razvan Roman</span>. I have spoken with <span class="highlight">Ellis Naylor</span> and I told her
								that I can't attend the classes due to work related issues. I am an HGV Class 1 Delivery Driver, and due to some nasty politics at
								work, they did not want to give me the shift in my work schedule to be able to participate in the course.

								But, if you would at least let me be part of the classroom and to the challenges, I think it would help me very much in leveling my
								skills in design and in web development. I have learned a lot about web development on my own and I would benefit grately if I have
								the chance to do all these challenges.
