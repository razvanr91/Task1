						Let's get to know each other. Like I said previously, my name is <span class="highlight">Razvan Roman</span>, I am 31 years old and
						happily married to my lovely wife <span class="highlight">Cristina</span>. We are both originally from Romania, and we came to the United
						Kingdom in November 2016.

						I love all kinds of music, but lately, I started to listen to a lot of Classical Music. I feel it calms me and helps me go through the day
						a lot easier.

						In 2019 I decided to make a change in my life, and I decided to start learning to <span class="highlight">Code</span>. Since then it has
						been a very interesting and exciting journey, filled with all kinds of challenges.
					</p>
					<p class="intro--text border-bottom">
						But I struggle with the <span class="highlight">Impostor Syndrome</span> and I can't seem to get rid of it. I have taken a lot of courses
						from <span class="highlight">Udemy</span> and a host of other <span class="highlight">instructors</span>, but I still feel like I am
						missing something. That is why I wanted to be part of this bootcamp. But my current workplace does not want to allow me the schedule
						flexibility in order to participate fully.
					</p>
					<p class="intro--text border-bottom">
						My shift start times are different from day to day and from week to week, so there is no way I could be online for the full duration of
						the courses. But I could still come online for part of them, or at least watch the session afterwords if it is recorded, and participate
						in the challeges.
					</p>
					<p class="intro--text">
						If there is any way in I could be part of the bootcamp considering my circumstances, please let me know on either one of my e-mail
						addresses:
						<br /><span class="highlight">razvanroman91@google.com</span> or
						<span class="highlight">razvan.roman91@outlook.com</span>
